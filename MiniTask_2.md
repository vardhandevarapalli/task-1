# [Arduino Nano Quadruped Robot](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Nano-Quadruped-Robot/)
## Problem Statement:-
Designing a spider like robot which can do creep gait movement when power is supplied.
## Ideation and Planning:-
understanding the quadruped robots mechanism.
- Portable Power Supply->Microcontroller->Adrduino Expansion shield->Servo Motors 

| Part of the Pipeline | Feasibility | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Portable Power Supply | easy to find a suitable powersupply but its a bit hard to include the power source inside the smaller designs and to power the projects for longer times  | gives power to the project without a need to connect to external sockets | sometimes Power discharge is irregular and causes the Micro controllers and chipsets to burn or get damaged |
| Microcontroller | Hard for a beginner to understand the Usage of the each Pins and to perfectly write the suitable code for the project  | has many features for making different projects and also has many libraries for the beginners to be able to code properly  | can easily be Damaged with high power supply than required and hard for the beginners to work with |
| Arduino Expansion Shield | it expands the Arduino Microcontroller to link other devices in a simple and trouble-free manner | acts as a breakout board for the Arduino microcontroller and each pinout includes 5V and GND pins for easy connection to sensors or servos | high voltages can cause the expansion shield to damage also parallely damaging the Microcontroller |
| Servo Motors | easy to control and can be customised and controlled  easily  | Angular motion, velocity control can be possible using a servo motor and works on defferent scales of voltage  | high torques makes the servo motors to fail and they are a bit expensive than regular motors |

I personally Do not feel like this project meets the constraints because this can only move forward and can not be controlled properly so i would like to ideate the solution again by changing and adding a few parts to the existing project to get to a better solution to the problem statement.
