# SOME COOL PROJECTS 
## Project:1 [Arduino Nano Quadruped Robot](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Nano-Quadruped-Robot/)
![Quadruped robot](https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/F7S/ISBT/L2RLCQSN/F7SISBTL2RLCQSN.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&width=1024&fit=bounds&md=447c6fd057e8f816d15d5d0368d3a84cl)
### Description:-
This is a cool quadruped robot which can move forward resembling the movement of a four legged insect.The structure of the robot is entirely built by 3d printing the parts.Eight servo motors are used in total for the legs of the robot.Each leg consists of two servo motors one is for forward and backward movement of the leg and the other is for the left and right movements of the legs The whole robot is powered using a battery pack and the robot starts moving forward when it is connected to power pack and it stops when it is disconnected from the power.
### Components:-
   - PLA Filament or PETG Filament
   - Arduino Nano
   - Arduino Nano Expansion Shield
   - 8 MG996R 55g Metal Servo Motor
   - M3 Screws (usually come with sg90 servos)
   - Mophie Juice Pack Powerstation Pro (any compatible power source is fine)
### Personal notes:-
These kind of projects are so useful for the military purpose but the above mentioned projects needs  a lot of changes to be useful enough for the military purposes the changes can be 
- the design can be changed a little bit and the legs shape can be changed into a point legs so that the legs have a nice grip for the movement at any terrain 
- There is a need to include the power pack inisde the project itself so that we dont need to keep it as a extra part and include a external controller for the working of the quadruped robot.
- if possible we can even add a claw in front of the robot so that we can pick up things and carry it.

### Description:-
   These days security in home became a very important thing and for that we take many methods one of them is surveillance. For that we use security cameras and wifi security cameras available in markets are really not that expensive but for the surveillance purpose we need many cameras that becomes a little bit expensice so in this project we are trying to make our own cheap wifi surviellance camera using a ESP32-CAM AI thinker WiFi camera module, in my opinion, one of the best and cheapest camera development boards out there which costs nearly ₹700 and we can complete the whole project in ₹1200 with the right supplies
   
   Here in this project we can live stream the video recorded by the ESP32 cam on ESP32 webserver by entering the ip address of the board and can watch the past recordings and the recordings are saved in SD card by mounting the SD card in the ESP32 cam module and the whole system is powered by two 18650 3.7V 2600mAh batteries connectd to the TP4056 1-cell Li-Ion Charging module.
### Components:-
- ESP32-CAM with OV2640 2MP camera sensor
- FTDI USB to Serial converter (for programming) + Female-to-female jumper wires
- 4GB MicroSD card (TF Card)
- Clip-on antenna
- TP4056 1-cell Li-Ion Charging module
- (x2) 18650 3.7V 2600mAh battery
- Mini SPDT sliding switch (3A toggle switch is recommended)
- Some 24-gauge electrical wire
- 3mm Red LED
- 220 Ohm resistor
- Cylindrical plastic container (choice of camera's enclosure is optional)
- GoPro mount accessories (if you want your camera to be attached to a wall)
### Personal notes:-
Now a days the quality of the surveillance are so bad because of the quality compromisation for low prices sake. Here in this project we can achieve a decent quality photage for the comparitively lower cost and we can even adjust the quality of the photage in this project
- In this project i would like to change the design of the camera
- I would also like to add a LED light to the design so that it turns on when the Camera is powered so that we can understand that we under the surveillance of the camera.

This project requires a lot of work with the 3d printed parts and also requires a knowledge of Fusion 360. but the project is truly fascinating. I would like to make the project remote control and also add a arm to it so that it can pick up objects and rocks like Perserverance rover does and also like to add a camera to it so that we can get the photogae or photos and also see the path of it.
## Project:5 [Particle Accelerator Demo](https://www.instructables.com/Particle-Accelerator-Demo/)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107262758/173621575-5d05f5f8-bb5b-4f3f-a055-ae22ff7a1a01.png)

### Description:-
Generally a particle accelerator accelerates charged particles out of hydrogen gas like electron and proton (not neutron cause charge less) or charged atoms in a vaccum and a controlled environment .As it is di􀀩culty to produce charged particles out of hydrogen gas at home, I decided to try slightly di􀀨erentapproach. Instead of charged particle I used magneticball bearing and instead of electric 􀀘led I used electroniccircuit to vary the magnetic 􀀘led produced by two coils.Once the electronics is switched on, the magnetic ballbearing will start moving inside circular track and accelerating it until it 􀀘nds an equilibrium. At that point magnetic sphere will move with constant speed.
### Components:-
- 1x 9V battery with battery clip
- 8mm magnetic sphere (10mm is 􀀘ne if you scale 3Dmodel model by 10%)
- 25 SWG enameled copper wire
- 1x 1000uF electrolytic capacitor
- 1x 1MOhm potentiometer
- 2x 100kOhm resistors
- 1 x 100Ohm resistor
- 1 x 1kOhm resistor
- 1 x 12kOhm resistor
- BC558 PNP transistor
- BC337 NPN transistor
- BD135 NPN transistor
- 1x 3mm Red LED
- 1x PCB on/o􀀨 switch
- Prototyping strip board (PCB for etching is optional)
- PLA (3d printing material)
- Equipment wire
### Personal Notes:-
this is just a fun project but yet i would like to increase no of coils and the radius of the accelerator so that we can have a bigger one and achieve high speeds.
## Project:6 [Human Detection Robot](https://www.electronicshub.org/human-detection-robot/)
### Description:-
Human detection robot is not a new technology. Many types of human detection robots were designed depending on the application. During the natural calamities like earthquakes, it is difficult to rescue the human beings under the buildings. Though detection by rescue team is done, it consumes a lot of time. Detection of human in appropriate time is very important in such situations. This project presents a simple human detection robot that is operated manually using RF technology.The main principle of the circuit is to detect the human using human detection sensor. The wireless robot is operated manually using PC. The wireless technology used here is Radio Frequency technology. The data is transmitted to receiver through RF. Using the received data, robot is operated and controlled.
### Components:-
- AT89s51 microcontroller.
- PIR sensor.
- RF transmitter and receiver.
- L293D IC.
- PC.
- Robot chassis.
- Max232 IC.
- 9V battery.
- Motors.

### Personal notes:-
In this project it uses the fact that the human body emitts infrared radiation and detects humans by it. I would also like to attach a camera to the robot so that we can see if humans are there at that place in natural calamatic situations.
## Project:7 [Mobile Jammer Circuit](https://www.electronicshub.org/mobile-jammer-circuit/)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107262758/173616524-f6f39e33-67be-426f-9a61-6cf88a4d560a.png)
### Description:-
A Mobile Jammer Circuit or a Cell Phone Jammer Circuit is an instrument or device that can prevent the reception of signals by Mobile Phones. Basically, a Mobile Jammer Circuit is an RF Transmitter, which broadcasts Radio Signals in the same (or similar) frequency range of the GSM Communication.Cell phone works at the frequency of 450 MHz frequency. To block this 450MHz frequency, we also need to generate 450Mhz frequency with some noise which will act as simple blocking signal, because cell phone receiver will not be able to understand to which signal it has been received. By this, we can able to block the cell phone signal from reaching the cell phones.
### Components:-
- 555 Timer IC
- Resistors – 220Ω x 2, 5.6KΩ, 6.8KΩ, 10KΩ, 82KΩ
- Capacitors – 2pF, 3.3pF, 4.7pF, 47pF, 0.1µF, 4.7µF, 47µF
- 30pF Trimmer Capacitor
- LED
- Coils 3 Turn 24 AWG, 4 Turn 24 AWG
- Antenna 15 Turn 24 AWG
- BF495 Transistor
- ON / OFF Switch
- 9V Battery

### Personal Notes:-
The above project can not fully jam the signals but they can be able to block the signals to certain level
