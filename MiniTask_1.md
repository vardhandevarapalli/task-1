### Description:-
This is a cool quadruped robot which can move forward resembling the movement of a four legged insect.The structure of the robot is entirely built by 3d printing the parts.Eight servo motors are used in total for the legs of the robot.Each leg consists of two servo motors one is for forward and backward movement of the leg and the other is for the left and right movements of the legs The whole robot is powered using a battery pack and the robot starts moving forward when it is connected to power pack and it stops when it is disconnected from the power.
### Components:-
   - PLA Filament or PETG Filament
   - Arduino Nano
   - Arduino Nano Expansion Shield
   - 8 MG996R 55g Metal Servo Motor
   - M3 Screws (usually come with sg90 servos)
   - Mophie Juice Pack Powerstation Pro (any compatible power source is fine)
### Personal notes:-
These kind of projects are so useful for the military purpose but the above mentioned projects needs  a lot of changes to be useful enough for the military purposes the changes can be 
- the design can be changed a little bit and the legs shape can be changed into a point legs so that the legs have a nice grip for the movement at any terrain 
- There is a need to include the power pack inisde the project itself so that we dont need to keep it as a extra part and include a external controller for the working of the quadruped robot.
- if possible we can even add a claw in front of the robot so that we can pick up things and carry it.
## Project:2 [ESP32 WiFi CCTV Camera](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Make-a-WiFi-Security-Camera-ESP32-CAM-DIY-R/)

   These days security in home became a very important thing and for that we take many methods one of them is surveillance. For that we use security cameras and wifi security cameras available in markets are really not that expensive but for the surveillance purpose we need many cameras that becomes a little bit expensice so in this project we are trying to make our own cheap wifi surviellance camera using a ESP32-CAM AI thinker WiFi camera module, in my opinion, one of the best and cheapest camera which costs nearly ₹700 and we can complete the whole project in ₹1200 with the right supplies 
these things 
development boards out there.
